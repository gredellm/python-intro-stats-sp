    "### Testing for Statistical Significance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, we commonly use the concept of *significance* to help judge the plausibility of a hypothesis about a population parameter, based on observed sample data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we first begin with an initial belief about the parameter (the *null hypothesis,* denoted by H<sub>0</sub>), and propose an *alternative hypothesis*, H<sub>A</sub>, to test with the data. We then analyze the data under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, and determine the probability that we would observe data *as or more extreme* than that our sample produced. This probability is referred to as a *p-value.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to conducting the hypothesis test we set a *significance level* for the test. The significance level represents a cut-off point for the null hypothesis - when the p-value for the data is sufficiently low (lower than the significance level), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative one. The significance level is denoted by $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a simple example in the binomial setting, to determine whether or not a coin is fair. First, we'll grab the CoinTosses dataset:"
